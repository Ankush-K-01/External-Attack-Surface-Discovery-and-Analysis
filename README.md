# External Attack Surface Discovery and Analysis

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## Overview

This project presents an automated workflow for **External Attack Surface Discovery (EASM)** and **security exposure analysis**. The system identifies publicly observable assets associated with a defined target domain, consolidates the discovered information, analyzes security exposures, enriches findings with threat intelligence, validates findings using AI, and prioritizes risks through deterministic scoring.

The workflow covers:

- External asset discovery
- Identity correlation
- Attack surface inventory
- Exposure discovery
- Brand and email security analysis
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- AI-assisted finding validation
- Risk prioritization
- Unified security reporting

> **Note:** The system is intended for authorized security assessments of explicitly defined target domains. Results represent findings identified by the implemented workflow and should not be interpreted as a guarantee that every possible asset or vulnerability has been identified.

## Project Objectives

The project focuses on four main objectives:

1. **Automate External Attack Surface Discovery**  
   Discover and analyze publicly exposed domains, subdomains, IP addresses, ports, services, web assets, and related external information.

2. **Identify Brand and Email Security Risks**  
   Identify potential lookalike domains and externally observable email-security risks using domain authentication information.

3. **Enrich Security Findings with Threat Intelligence**  
   Add vulnerability and threat context using **NVD, CISA KEV, and EPSS**.

4. **Validate and Prioritize Security Findings**  
   Use AI-assisted validation to assess finding credibility and support false-positive identification, while using deterministic risk scoring for consistent prioritization.

## System Workflow

The system follows a connected processing workflow:

                v
        Unified Reporting
```

Each stage uses structured records associated with a common scope identifier. A shared SQLite database is used to maintain information across the workflow.

## Key Modules

### 1. Scope Management

The system validates and normalizes the target domain, creates a unique scope identifier, and initializes the assessment workflow. The scope identifier is maintained throughout the assessment to provide traceability between the target and collected results.

### 2. Asset Discovery

The discovery layer performs external reconnaissance using multiple sources to identify publicly observable assets, including:

- Subdomains
- DNS records
- IP addresses
- Open ports
- Services
- URLs
- Historical and web-related observations

The use of multiple discovery sources reduces dependency on a single enumeration tool.

### 3. Identity Correlation

Discovered assets are correlated with identity-related information such as:

- Domains
- IP addresses
- SSL/TLS certificates
- ASN information
- Ownership-related observations

This stage establishes relationships between otherwise separate discovery records.

### 4. Attack Surface Inventory

The inventory module normalizes and consolidates discovery and correlation results into a unified, asset-centric representation.

Duplicate or overlapping observations are merged so that subsequent security analysis can operate on a structured view of the external attack surface.

### 5. Exposure Discovery

The system analyzes the unified asset inventory for security exposures using multiple security-analysis techniques, including:

- Vulnerability analysis
- TLS analysis
- Technology fingerprinting
- Directory and parameter discovery
- Web security analysis
- Subdomain takeover detection

The collected observations are normalized into structured security findings.

### 6. Brand and Email Intelligence

This module identifies externally observable brand and email-security risks associated with the target organization.

The analysis includes:

- Lookalike domains
- Lookalike certificates
- SPF
- DKIM
- DMARC
- BIMI

This extends the assessment beyond infrastructure and application security to include brand and email-related exposure.

### 7. Threat Intelligence Enrichment

Security findings are enriched with external threat intelligence to provide additional vulnerability and exploitation context.

The project uses:

- **NVD** – CVE and vulnerability information
- **CISA KEV** – Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
- **EPSS** – Exploitability probability

This enrichment provides additional context for understanding the significance and exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.

### 8. AI-Assisted Validation and Risk Prioritization

AI is used as a supporting validation mechanism for structured security findings. It assists in evaluating finding credibility, identifying potential false positives, and providing remediation guidance.

Risk prioritization is performed separately using a deterministic scoring mechanism based on available security and threat context. AI is therefore not treated as the sole source of the final risk decision.

### 9. Unified Reporting

The reporting module consolidates the finalized assessment data and presents the results in structured formats.

Supported output formats include:

- HTML
- PDF
- XLSX
- JSON
- CSV

The reporting layer provides both human-readable reports and machine-readable outputs for further analysis.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular REST-service architecture.

The web interface communicates with the backend through an API gateway. Functional processing stages operate on structured assessment data stored in a shared SQLite database.

```text
Web Interface
      |
      v
API Gateway
      |
      v
Workflow / Backend Services
      |
      +---- Asset Discovery
      +---- Identity Correlation
      +---- Inventory
      +---- Exposure Analysis
      +---- Brand & Email Intelligence
      +---- Threat Intelligence
      +---- AI Validation
      +---- Risk Prioritization
      +---- Reporting
      |
      v
SQLite Database
```

The shared database maintains scope information, discovery observations, correlated identity information, unified assets, exposure findings, threat-intelligence results, validation results, and reporting data.

## Threat Intelligence and Risk Scoring

Threat intelligence provides additional context to security findings through CVE information, known exploitation status, and exploitability probability.

The final risk score uses a deterministic approach and incorporates adjusted finding scores with known exploitation and WAF-related factors.

The resulting score is classified into the following levels:

| Risk Score | Risk Level |
|---:|---|
| 9.0–10.0 | CRITICAL |
| 7.0–8.9 | HIGH |
| 4.0–6.9 | MEDIUM |
| 0.1–3.9 | LOW |
| ≤ 0.0 | INFO |

This separation between **AI-assisted validation** and **deterministic risk scoring** provides a more traceable approach to finding validation and prioritization.

## Example Assessment Results

The implemented workflow produced evidence across multiple assessment stages, including:

- **79** subdomains
- **12** IP addresses
- **15** open ports
- **338** total security findings
- **61** CVE matches
- **2** CISA KEV matches
- **3** EPSS scores
- **104** lookalike domains
- **71** lookalike certificates

These results are consolidated through the reporting layer to provide a unified view of the assessment.

## External Services and Requirements

The implementation uses several external services for reconnaissance, enrichment, and AI-assisted validation.

Required services include:

- Google Gemini API
- Censys API
- NVD
- CISA KEV
- FIRST EPSS
- crt.sh
- HackerTarget

The system requires Internet connectivity because parts of the workflow depend on external reconnaissance and threat-intelligence services.

API credentials may be required for services such as Google Gemini and Censys.

## Project Structure

The implementation is organized around functional workflow stages rather than individual tool outputs:

```text
Scope Management
       |
Asset Discovery
       |
Identity Correlation
       |
Attack Surface Inventory
       |
Exposure Discovery
       |
Brand & Email Intelligence
       |
Threat Intelligence
       |
AI Validation
       |
Risk Prioritization
       |
Unified Reporting
```

The shared database allows each stage to consume structured information generated by earlier stages while maintaining a common assessment scope.

## Testing

The project includes functional testing for the major workflow components, including:

- Scope creation
- Asset discovery
- Identity correlation
- Attack surface inventory
- Exposure discovery
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- Brand and email intelligence
- AI validation
- Unified reporting

Testing also considers subprocess timeouts, API rate limiting, and partial processing failures.

## Project Scope

The project focuses specifically on **externally observable assets and security exposures associated with explicitly defined target domains**.

It is not intended to represent a complete assessment of an organization's entire internal or technology environment. The workflow focuses on external attack-surface discovery and exposure analysis within the defined assessment scope.

## Conclusion

This project integrates established reconnaissance, exposure-analysis, threat-intelligence, AI-assisted validation, risk-prioritization, and reporting techniques into a single automated workflow.

The primary contribution is the **integration of these capabilities into a cohesive External Attack Surface Discovery and Exposure Analysis pipeline**, providing a structured way to discover external assets, correlate security information, enrich findings, validate results, prioritize risks, and generate unified reports.
